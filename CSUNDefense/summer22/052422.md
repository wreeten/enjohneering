## What Are We Trying to Achieve?
Our goal for this project is to design and build a Defense Drone that will eliminate all ground and air threats.

## Why Are We Doing This?
The main purpose of this project is to provide experience for students at CSU Northridge the exposure in working in Defense. 
Also, with the current events happening, a group of students saw the potential of drones of what it can do offensively. CSUN Defense hopes to provide the safety of the looming threat of our nation.
