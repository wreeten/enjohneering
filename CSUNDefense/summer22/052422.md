## What Are We Trying to Achieve?
Our goal for this project is to design and build a Defense Drone that will eliminate all ground and air threats.

## Why Are We Doing This?
The main purpose of this project is to provide experience for students at CSU Northridge the exposure in working in Defense. 
Also, with the current events happening, a group of students saw the potential of drones of what it can do offensively. CSUN Defense hopes to provide the safety of the looming threat of our nation.

## Concept Design
![CSUN Defense](/CSUNDefense/imgs/firstDesign.png)

Our first prototype of the design, brainstorming will begin today.
The wings will be articulated.
The conical head will have sensors: heat, lidar, and camera.

## Sub Teams?
1. Systems
2. Communications
3. Powers

## What Will We Need to Make This?

### Brain
1. Jetson Nano | Raspberry Pi

### General
2. Brushless Motor
3. Propellor
4. ESC
5. GPS
6. Flight Controller
7. RX/TX 
8. Battery
9. Servos

### Sensors
10. Camera| Night Vision | Thermal 
11. Lidar
12. Temperature

### Programming Language
13. Python (for now)

## What Does That Do?

**Jetson Nano | Raspberry Pi** : The Main Brain Man
We will utilize its calculating abilities for machine learning, threat detection, and target lock mechanism. 

**Brushless Motor & Propellor** : Will Produce Thrust

**Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)** : The circuit that controls the speed of our Brushless Motor 

**Global Positioning System (GPS)** : Locating the Drone (just in case we lose sight of it) 

**Flight Controller** : The brain of our drone, which has the ability to monitor and control what the drone does.

**Receiver and Transmitter (Remote)** : Ideally we want our Drone to work autonamously, but the the purpose of the remote is for emergency operations.

**Battery** : The energy for our Drone

**Servos** The joints of our Drones


#### Why Python?
We believe that in early stages, Python would be ideal since there are many supported libraries of implementing python with drones, and it is easy to understand. However, if/when the team continues to progress, we hope to begin utilizing C for performance and optimization.
