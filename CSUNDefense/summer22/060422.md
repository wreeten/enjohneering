### Why Are We Doing This? > Refined
The purpose of this project is to provide experience for our students to work as team, understand agile approach, and gain experience in desiging and building defense weaponry. 


### What Is Agile Approach?
Project management tool, many are used, but this is what I found was the easiest in our setting. It is a cyclical approach with the improvements every meeting with the end goal in mind.

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Review

#### Sub Team:

##### Systems: 
What would you like to implement in our design? What algorithms should be used, does A* work with this use case?
* Inform on Jetson Nano 
* Try to understand and how to use AI

##### Communications: 
What would you like to implement in our design?
* What does the CubicSDR do?
* How do we build something that will prevent our RC remote from communicating with our drone? 2.4GHz 

##### MechElec:
What would you like to implement in our design?
* One, better design lol worry about flight first, John

> Ask if people are interested in github, instead of Google Drive.

#### Tasks for sub teams next meeting:
##### Systems: 
Learn more about openCV, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and how will we begin implementing it with our drone? 
What is considered a threat?
What means could we do in terms of eliminating threat?

##### Communications:
Learn about antennas, and how we can build a simple one? 
How can we detect incoming threat with comms devices?
How do spook a gps?
