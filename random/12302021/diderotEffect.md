### Diderot Effect:
Possession of "new" luxurious item doesn't necessarily make you happy, but may cause sadness. Due to the unity of one's possession, where the new luxury item may clash with other items one owns. 
Unity, the need for unity is leaves us a desire to upgrade our items that match our new luxury item.
Each purchase makes us look at our other things we own, and we'd naturally want us to upgrade the things we currently own, even if they're still functioning properly.
"I was absolute master of my old dressing gown, but I have become a slave to my new one" -Diderot
