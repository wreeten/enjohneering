# What is Jacobian?
[https://youtu.be/wCZ1VEmVjVo]

Linear Maps
1. parallel lines stay parallel
2. even spacings preserved
3. origin is fixed

In Two Dimension,
Matrix, an array of numbers capturing the essence of linear map (3:44)
Area grows along with the scaling factor, called the determinant. 
Linear map is summed up in a matrix 

In One Dimension,
matrix is reduced to One number, which is the scaling factor
determinant in 1d, we replace the area as "length"
Kinda got lost after 8:54. Should go back and reread my Calculus textbook.

Jacobian matrix is the matrix representing linear map approcimation of f near (a,b)

-- continues anyway
Oh this is interesting

We have a rod, we want to find the mass. Desnsity is different for each places. To find the mass, we can chop the rod into individual pieces then add them together, assuming uniform desnity. While we assume the uniform desnity, when we chop the rod into multiple pieces, we can then calculate that chopped rod then multiply it to get the equal value of the length of the total rod. I actually never thought of it like this, sad! 

Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat>???? 
Integration by Substitution!!! Explained so well! My mind is blown! (19:27)

-- Subscribes to Mathemaniac -- lol, makes me want to revisit my calculus book.
